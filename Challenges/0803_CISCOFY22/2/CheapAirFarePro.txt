2. Cheap Airfare Pro
Anjali has started a new travel agency. She noticed that the air fares between the cities are not symmetrical. That is, the cost of flying from a to b is not the same as that of b to a. Further there is no guarantee that once you fly directly from a to b there is a direct return flight. 
She knows that passengers do not mind changing flights as long as the total airfare is minimized. She will advertise the lowest round trip cost between any pair of tourist interest to attract potential passengers. All valid flights i.e. (A, B, P(A,B)) where A is the source city of touristic interest B is the destination city of touristic interest and P(A,B) is the price of the ticket in rupees are at her disposal. 
Help her determine the top 2 lowest round trip costs.

Input Format 
The first line consists of integer n indicating the number of cities.
The second line consists of integer m indicating the number of flights.
Each of the next m lines contains 3 integers separated by a space - starting city A, end city B and the price of the ticket P(A,B) for flight from A to B. 

Constraints 
1 < Number of cities < 100 
0 < Number of flights < 5000 
0 < Price <10000 

Output Format
Print the price for the top 2 Cheapest round trip as a list/array. A value of 1000000 indicates infinity. The price of an impossible trip is assumed to be infinity.

For example, we need to calculate the round trip between City 1 and City 3: 
Cost(1, 3) = P(1, 3) =30, because there are only one simple way to go to there. 
Cost(3, 1) = P(3, 2) + P(2, 0) + P(0, 1) = 60.
So the cheapest round trip from City 1 and City 3 is equal to 30 + 60 = 90 units. 
we can calculate all the other round trip in the similar way. The best fares are 40 & 
40.
