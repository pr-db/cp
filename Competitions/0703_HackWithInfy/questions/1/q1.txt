You are given array A with n integers and a set B with m integers. 
You are allowed to change any integer Ai (1<= i <=n) in A to any positive integer X if Ai doesn't appear in the set B. 
Find the minimum number of changes needed to make the array A strictly increasing. 

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in A.
The next line contains an integer, m, denoting the number of elements in B. 
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < n) Contains an integer describing A[i]. 
Each line i of the m subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < m) contains an integer describing B[i]. 

Constraints 
1 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= m <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 1=^5
1 <= B[i] <= 10^5
